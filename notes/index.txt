# GEM Registry System

The registry is spread accross nodes,
at a top level there is a resolver which maps top level UUID's to top level objects,

The central data structure of the registry is an object and it is similar to a Javascript object, Python dictionary or Lua table. Like a node it can have parents and children. Every object should have a UUID.

GEMx doesn't expose a filesystem just the interface to this registry.
